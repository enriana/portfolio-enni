## üìÇ Portfolio Projects

### Predicting Spotify Track Skips to Improve User Engagement
* **Objective:** To improve user engagement and retention, the project's goal was to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a user will skip a track with at least 70% accuracy, enabling the refinement of Spotify's recommendation algorithm.
* **Methodology:** Analyzed ~150,000 streaming records using **Python (Pandas)**, built and tuned a **Weighted Random Forest** model with **Scikit-learn**, and visualized findings in an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard.
* **Key Results:** Achieved **91.12% model accuracy**, far exceeding the 70% target. Uncovered that **77.4% of skips occur in the first 30 seconds** and **93.5% of skips originate from the Android platform**.
