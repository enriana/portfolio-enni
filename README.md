Portfolio Projects
Project 1: Predicting Spotify Track Skips to Improve User Engagement
This project aimed to improve user retention on Spotify by building a model to predict if a user would skip a track, enabling the refinement of the recommendation algorithm.



Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict track skips with over 70% accuracy.


Methodology: Cleaned and analyzed a dataset of ~150,000 streaming records using Python (pandas). Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built a Tuned Weighted Random Forest model using 


scikit-learn. Visualized findings with 

seaborn and matplotlib, presenting them in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Key Insights & Results:

The model achieved 

91.12% accuracy, significantly exceeding the 70% target.

Identified that 

77.4% of skips occur within the first 30 seconds, indicating immediate content mismatch.


Discovered that 

93.5% of all skips originated from the Android platform, suggesting potential platform-specific issues.


Actionable Recommendations:


Optimize the First 30 Seconds: Prioritize tracks with strong openings and use early skips as a key signal for poor recommendations.


Investigate the Android Platform: Conduct a full technical and UX audit on the Android app to resolve potential friction points contributing to the high skip rate.


Implement Time-Aware Recommendations: Adapt suggestions to the user's context, such as offering calmer music during late-night hours when skip rates are highest.

Project 2: RevoBank Sales Performance Analysis & Customer Segmentation
This project analyzed six months of credit card transaction data to understand sales performance and segment customers for targeted marketing campaigns to drive higher engagement.


Objective: To segment existing clients into distinct user personas based on their financial profiles and transaction behaviors.


Methodology: Performed data cleaning and feature engineering using Python and pandas. Applied 

K-Means Clustering (scikit-learn) to segment users based on metrics like transaction recency, frequency, and Debt-to-Income ratio. Visualized segment characteristics using 



matplotlib and seaborn.

Key Insights & Results:

Identified two primary customer segments: 

"The Engaged Spender" (highly active, older, financially healthy) and "The Latent User" (inactive, younger, but with high income and untapped potential).


Discovered that while fraud accounted for only 0.22% of transaction volume, it resulted in over 

Rp1 billion in losses over six months.

Actionable Recommendations:

For "The Engaged Spender": Focus on retention. Implement tiered loyalty programs, provide personalized offers, and cross-sell premium financial products.

For "The Latent User": Focus on activation. Launch targeted campaigns with first-transaction incentives and improve the new client onboarding process to educate them on card benefits.
